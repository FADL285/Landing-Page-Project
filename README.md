## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

## Template Structure

- ### Index

  This file represents the skeleton of the landing page. Within the header, you'll find the navigation outlined. Within the body, five sections are added, to begin with.

- ### Styles
  Most of the code here was taken from the Skeleton code provided by Udacity. This gives the landing page the look and feels that you see and experience.

* ### App
  Here is where the functionality happens. There are four things that this file primarily achieves. The first is dynamically building out the navigation. We loop through the number of implemented sections and generate an area in the header for each one. Second is allowing the header to show which section is currently "active" on the page. Third, listen for clicks on the navigation and then scrolls the page to the appropriate section header. Finally, Hide navigation while not scrolling
